* Introduction

I came across [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Str8ts][str8ts]] puzzles recently and want to implement a solver in Common
Lisp similar to my [[https://github.com/MartinBuchmann/binoxxo][binoxxo]] solver. I am using basic ideas from [[http://norvig.com/sudoku.html][Peter Norvig's
Soduko solver]] as implemented [[https://github.com/dimitri/sudoku][here]] or [[https://github.com/tkych/cl-sudoku][here]] in Common Lisp.

While in a Sudoku puzzle the units are always the same for every puzzle, in
str8ts the units have to be found for each puzzle due to varying the blocked
fields and digits.

I have chosen to encode an blocked field with =10= and a digit within a blocked
field with a negative integer.  A puzzle is read from a text file with one
puzzle per line given a integers from =-9= to =10= separated by white space.

Load the program /when finished/ with:
#+begin_src common-lisp
(asdf:make :str8ts)
#+end_src

/to be continued.../
